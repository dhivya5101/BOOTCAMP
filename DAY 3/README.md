Task: Refreshing Python OOP Concepts


What I Learned:

This task helped me revisit Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
I reviewed how to define classes and implement methods, along with effectively passing parameters.
I deepened my understanding of inheritance, where child classes inherit attributes and behaviors from parent classes.
I explored encapsulation, learning the differences between public, protected (_), and private (__) attributes in Python.
I reinforced my knowledge of polymorphism, which allows modifying or extending functionalities for more flexible code.

Challenges Faced:

Since I had previously learned OOP concepts, recalling all the details and applying them in new contexts required some effort.
Understanding practical implementations of encapsulation in real-world scenarios took additional practice.
Final Thought:
This task was highly beneficial in strengthening my Python OOP knowledge. It enhanced my coding skills and boosted my confidence for future projects and placements
